## Put your money where it matters

Make a direct impact with your savings to build and improve your local community.

## Better than the banks

Not only does your money make a direct impact locally, it's directly backed by your municipality and that obligation is directly registered to you.

Unlike a bank, cities and counties are transparent and accountable to you as a voter. You judge whether they are trustworthy to hold and guarantee your investment.

Munidollars are municipal bonds at heart, so you can enjoy tax-free interest rates with low risks.
