## The Berkeley Bucks Proposal

The City of Berkeley has issued a Request For Proposal for Minibond issues that will take leverage blockchain technologies to create tokenized assets. The deadline for responses is March 5th, 2020.  

Flux is excited to be one of the responders to this RFP and we believe that the Munidollar Program meets and exceeds the City's expectations. If you want to see the response, you can view it [here](../../assets/files/Flux%20Response.pdf).
