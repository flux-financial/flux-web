# Better than the banks

Not only does your money make a direct impact locally, it's directly backed by your municipality.

Unlike a bank, cities and counties are transparent, and you can tell whether they are trustworthy to hold and guarantee your investment.

Munidollars are municipal bonds at heart, so you can enjoy great interest rates with low risks.
