The Munidollar is a concept for adding a new tool to current Municipal Finance practices. Currently no Munidollars exist. Therefore, nothing in this site should be construed as an offer of securities or solicitation for investment. If and when Munidollars do exist, Flux Holdings Inc. will register subsidiaries under SEC, MSRB and FINRA regulation in order to facilitate the Municipal governments to issue and maintain Munidollar programs.
