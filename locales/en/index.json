			"Munidollars will be issued directly by cities and counties, backed by their taxing authority and be convertible into one-year municipal bonds. Using Munidollars, cities and counties will be able to build a better municipal banking system for themselves and their constituents. These local US governments will issue US dollar denominated Munidollars that can be used for investment, savings and commerce, both local and digital.",
			"Unlike traditional financial assets, Munidollars will be directly registered with the city or county and do not take on additional banking or other counter-party risk. The result will be better local banking targeted directly at improving our local economies."
